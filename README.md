## <a name="about_me">About me (in a nutshell) 😄</a>

A proactive, dynamic, and creative Full Stack Software Developer by day. An arm-wrestling, chess-playing aficionado by night.

My career thus far has spanned investment research and management pertaining to institutional clients, pensions and charities. My interests started in data science/machine learning but I have been drawn to software development by its potential to be applied in all manners of fields, including e-commerce, fraud detection, and medical healthcare.

My ideal company shares my goal of moving the world forward and creating real, tangible benefits for society. I am currently entwined within the intensive 16 week software development course at Makers Academy. I am eager to use my driven nature, analytical mind, and rapidly developing tech skills to help them achieve this.
